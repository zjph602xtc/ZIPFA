The 'laser' folder contains functions that are part of the 'Fathom Toolbox for Matlab'. These functions provide support for processing raw time series data generated by Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), with primary focus on fish otolith microchemistry. Examples and tutorials related to these functions can be found in the 'Fathom/laser/examples' folder.

In order to use these functions you must add the 'laser' folder to Matlab's path: File > Set Path... > Add Folder...
