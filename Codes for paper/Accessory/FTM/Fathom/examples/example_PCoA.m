% This is an artificial data set comprising 19 sample sites and 9 species:
% Y       = abundance values of species for each site
% yLabels = cell array of species names
% sLabels = cell array of site names
% 
% (Source: Figure 3 in Legendre, P., and E. E. Gallagher. 2001.
% Ecologically meaningful transformations for ordination of species data. Oecologia 129: 271?280.) 

% Load the data:
load legendre_gallagher.mat;

% Create a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix among observations:
dis = f_dis(Y,'bc');

% Perform Principal Coordinates Analysis, show diagnostic plots:
pcoa = f_pcoa(dis,1);

% Create ordination diagram and biplot vectors (use 'weighted' vectors
% because the data represents species abundance data):
f_pcoaPlot(pcoa,sLabels,Y,yLabels,0,'none',1)

% This is data from van der Aart & Smeenk-Enserink (1975) and is Hunting spider
% abundances for 12 species (spiders) taken from 28 sites (labels) and
% associated environmental data (env).

% Create a Euclidean distance matrix among observations:
