% 
% Use an F-ratio based stepwise variable selection procedure with a distance-based
% RDA (db-RDA) approach to build a model depicting the relationship between
% a set of environmenal metrics with the benthic community in the North
% Sea. The file 'ekofisk.mat' consists of North Sea Ekofisk oil field  data
% from Gray et al., (1988) and has the following variables:
% 
% biotic     = abundance of 174 species of soft-bottom benthic macrofauna from 39 sites
% biotic_txt = cell array of corresponding column labels
% env        = values of 10 environmental variables from the same 39 sites
% env_txt    = cell array of corresponding column labels:
%       'Dist': distance (km) from center of drilling activity
%        'THC': total hydrocarbon concentration
%      'Redox': redox potential (~ organic matter)
%       '%Mud': percent of sediment that was mud
%    Phi_mean': mean sediment particle size
%         'Ba': sediment Barium concentration (nontoxic, tracer for drilling muds)
%         'Sr': sediment Strontium concentration
%         'Cu': sediment Copper concentration
%         'Pb': sediment Lead concentration
%         'Ni': sediment Nickel concentration
