The files in the BIN directory contain scripts for working with PDF and Postscript files. They should be moved to your ~/bin/ directory and that directory should be added to the path of your UNIX bash shell. You'll also need to have a working copy of Ghostscript and LaTeX installed on our system.

The scripts have been tested with Mac OS 10.4, but could be ported to other UNIX systems.
